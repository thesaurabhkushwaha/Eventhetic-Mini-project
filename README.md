# **Eventhetic-Mini-project**
* Plan was to make a basic website to hold information about events (seminars, product launches, science exhibitions etc.) being organized revolving around academics.

* This project allows admin to login (just by matching backend password stored in md5, no session management) and perform CRUD operations.

* Made using **HTML,CSS,Bootstrap, XAMPP and PHP** in an effort to get familiar with these technologies and complete the college requirements.

* This project will be re-done and re-designed using Django with basic user authentication and better use of code.

* This was submitted as "Mini project" under the "Web Technologies" subject of seventh semester BE CSE degree by me.
